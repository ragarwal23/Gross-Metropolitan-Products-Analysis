## Introduction

The Gross Metropolitan Product (GMP) is a key economic indicator that measures the economic performance of metropolitan areas. In this analysis, we delve into the GMP data of different metropolitan areas to identify patterns, trends, and factors contributing to their economic growth.

## Data

The analysis is based on publicly available GMP data, which can be found in the directory. The dataset includes GMP figures for multiple metropolitan areas over a specific time period.

## Methodology

Our analysis follows these main steps:

1. Data Collection: Gathering GMP data from reliable sources.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing the data for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing and summarizing the data to identify initial patterns.
4. Statistical Modeling: Applying statistical techniques to uncover relationships and factors influencing GMP.
5. Interpretation: Deriving meaningful insights from the analysis results.

## Results

Our analysis reveals the following:

- A positive correlation between population growth and GMP increase.
- The service sector's significant contribution to GMP.
- Economic challenges faced by specific metropolitan areas.
